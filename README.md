# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. it contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

My motivation to create this project is to prove myself what I am capable of doing.
 I build this project because I am learning how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work, what I did is the basic on those languages and I find it challengin. 
I learned how to create and style a website, how to move around git and the basics on JavaScript
